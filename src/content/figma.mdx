### Company Overview

Figma was founded in 2012 to eliminate the gap between imagination and reality. Thirteen years later, Figma has become the world's leading engine for product design and development. As we enter the age of AI, this founding vision feels more achievable than ever, helping individuals and teams translate ideas from mind to screen with unprecedented ease.

While companies often struggle with diminishing ideas as they scale, Figma operates from abundance. Figma actively pursue bold initiatives, strategic investments, and transformative acquisitions when opportunities align with our platform's growth. Figma's commitment remains steadfastly long-term, requiring patient investors who understand that sustainable value creation takes precedence over quarterly fluctuations.

AI represents Figma's most significant investment area, one where Figma plans to accelerate spending despite potential short-term efficiency impacts. While today's AI features merely scratch the surface, they herald a fundamental evolution in design workflows. The possibilities for AI to democratize design—bringing more people into the creative process while empowering existing designers—are virtually limitless.

The internet boom's "build it and they will come" mentality has become obsolete. In today's saturated market where creating an MVP is trivial, design has emerged as the primary differentiator. No longer an afterthought, design now determines success or failure. Design transcends aesthetics. It embodies strategy, and the world needs more designers in leadership positions.

As organizations recognize design, craft, and perspective as core competitive advantages, there will be increased experimentation and creative expression. This evolution will attract diverse contributors to the design process, requiring Figma to balance accessibility with sophisticated functionality while fostering collaborative decision-making at organizational scale.

We're currently in the MS-DOS era of AI, where prompts serve as the primary interface. As design patterns mature, we'll see deeper, domain-specific applications emerge. Just as the graphical user interface made computing accessible to everyday users, exceptional design will unlock AI's full potential for broader audiences.

Despite accelerating technological change creating apparent chaos, the future promises excitement and opportunity. Ultimately, tools don't transform the world. People do. Figma aspires to be a peaceful garden where ideas flourish, empowering users to make our world incrementally better, one design at a time.
